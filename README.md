### üöÄ About Me  

I'm a DevOps-oriented Technical Business Analyst with 7+ years of experience driving digital transformation across FinTech, cloud, and platform integration domains. My expertise bridges development, QA, and operations, with a strong focus on automation, scalability, and secure systems.

üîπ I've led end-to-end API integrations (RESTful / JSON), CI/CD pipeline design (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI), and Infrastructure-as-Code with Terraform & Ansible.  
üîπ Skilled in troubleshooting complex production issues, managing system configurations, and debugging using tools like Postman, ELK Stack, and Putty/SSH.  
üîπ Delivered enterprise migrations (e.g., FIS CMS from C++ to Java), ISO-compliant API transformations, and 3DS SDK configurations across banking platforms.  
üîπ Passionate about cloud (AWS, GCP), observability, and collaborative DevOps culture ‚Äî with hands-on experience in BDD, API testing (Rest Assured, Selenium), and stakeholder engagement.  
üîπ I love building efficient, automated solutions that empower cross-functional teams and improve service delivery at scale.
